"""Test that the Incus guest API is disabled inside COI containers.

The Incus guest API (/dev/incus) exposes the full device topology including
host source paths (username, workspace location, which paths are RO-protected).
This is a reconnaissance aid for mount namespace bypass attacks.

COI does NOT use the guest agent internally — it communicates with containers
via the host admin socket. Disabling the guest API has zero impact on COI
functionality.

See FLAWS.md Finding 3.
