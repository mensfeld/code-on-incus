"""End-to-end regression tests for issue #610 — stale security disk devices must
not wedge a persistent container on restart, and protection must be re-established.

Background
----------
COI protects security-sensitive paths by attaching one read-only Incus disk
device per path (``protect-husky``, ``protect-claude-settingsjson``, secret-mask
``mask-*`` and worktree ``gitc-*`` families) whose ``source=`` is a host path.
Incus validates every disk device's source at container **start**: a missing
source aborts the start with ``Missing source path``.

On a fresh launch the security setup materializes each source before attaching
the device, so it always exists. But that setup runs ONLY on a fresh launch. On
reuse/restart of a persistent container the creation-time devices keep their
original sources; if a source was removed from the workspace while the container
was stopped, the restart wedges and a fresh ``coi run`` never self-heals it
(issue #610).

The fix strips the workspace-sourced security devices (``protect-*``/``mask-*``/
``gitc-*``) and RE-RUNS the same validated security setup a fresh launch uses,
BEFORE start, on both restart seams (``coi run`` via a ``preRestart`` hook, and
``coi shell`` — see tests/shell/persistent/). Because it re-runs the fresh-launch
code, all the materialization / symlink-rejection / type / missing-path handling
comes from one place, and protection is re-established to match the CURRENT
workspace (paths added, removed, or replaced since first launch).

These tests drive the real ``coi run`` persistent flow. Each maps to a reviewed
failure mode:

- removed default dir / file / user path → restart must succeed (core wedge)
- protection re-established (write blocked, placeholder empty) after restart
- re-establishment after a removed path is later recreated
- source replaced by a dangling symlink → must not wedge (Lstat gate)
- parent directory replaced by a file (ENOTDIR) → must not wedge
- default dir replaced by a file (type drift) → must not wedge

Each test uses a unique workspace (pytest tmp_path) so container names never
collide even though slots repeat.
