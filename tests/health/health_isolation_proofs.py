"""
Runtime isolation proofs in `coi health` — the adversarial checks that verify
COI's guarantees actually hold inside a container, not just that config parses:

  - secret_masking: plant a decoy secret in a workspace, mask it via secret_paths,
    and confirm it reads EMPTY inside the container (a leak is a hard failure).
  - network_restriction: now also asserts the cloud metadata endpoint
    (169.254.169.254) is blocked, not just RFC1918.

These checks launch an ephemeral container, so they require the coi-default image
+ nft. Where that isn't available the check reports "skipped" (Warning) and the
deep assertions are skipped rather than failing.
