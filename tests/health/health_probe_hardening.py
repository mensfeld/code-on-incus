"""
E2E test: `coi health` probe containers honor the kernel-surface policy.

The four runtime-isolation probes (connectivity, network restriction, secret
masking, host-credential isolation) launch short-lived real containers. Under
[security] reduce_kernel_surface those probes must NOT silently boot with the
full docker/nesting surface — the exact class of widening the policy exists
to prevent.

The probes only live a few seconds, so the test runs `coi health` in the
background and polls `incus list` fast, snapshotting each probe container's
expanded config the moment it appears.
