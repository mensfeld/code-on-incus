"""
Meta test for install.sh's ensure_incus_initialized() against a REAL Incus
daemon (#703).

Context: the stubbed Go tests in internal/installer/install_sh_test.go drive
ensure_incus_initialized with a fake `incus` binary, so they can only assert
what we *assume* real `incus` output looks like. #703 was exactly a wrong
assumption about that output: the function treated any non-empty
`incus network list` as "already initialized", but on a real host that list is
never empty (unmanaged physical/loopback interfaces), so init was skipped on
fresh installs and the default profile was left deviceless.

This test closes that gap by running the ACTUAL install.sh logic against a
genuine, freshly-installed-but-not-`admin init`'d Incus daemon inside a nested
container. It validates the three real-world facts the Go stubs cannot:

  1. A fresh daemon has no MANAGED=YES network -> ensure_incus_initialized must
     decide to run init. (On bare metal the list is also non-empty with unmanaged
     interfaces -- the exact #703 trigger -- but a nested daemon does not surface
     host interfaces, so we don't require that shape here; the Go stub tests pin
     it deterministically.)
  2. A real storage pool makes `incus storage list --format=csv` non-empty ->
     ensure_incus_initialized must decide to SKIP init (the mitigation added on
     top of the #703 fix: a host with a custom network and no managed bridge is
     still initialized, and its pool is the reliable signal).
  3. A real MANAGED network renders column 3 of the CSV as the literal `YES` ->
     ensure_incus_initialized must decide to SKIP init.

Like tests/installer/zfs_gate_arch_e2e.sh, the privileged action is intercepted
by a RECORDING `sudo` shim: we assert the *decision* install.sh makes (did it
reach for `incus admin init --auto`?) driven by real `incus` reads, rather than
actually running a nested `admin init` (whose bridge/pool creation is flaky
under nesting). The `incus` reads themselves are 100% real.

Requires a host `incus` and nested-Incus support; skips cleanly otherwise.
