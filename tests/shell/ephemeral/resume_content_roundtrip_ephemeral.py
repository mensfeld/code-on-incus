"""
Ephemeral --resume actually round-trips the tool config directory's CONTENT.

The existing resume tests only assert the log strings ("Session data saved" /
"Resuming session") — the dummy prints "Resuming session" merely from being handed
a session ID, so a broken saveSessionData/restoreSessionData (PushDirectory /
Chown) would still pass. This test proves the real save→restore:

  session 1: write a sentinel file into the tool config dir ($HOME/.claude), then
             poweroff (ephemeral: container deleted, config dir pulled to the host)
  session 2 (--resume): the sentinel must be present in the FRESH container with
             identical content and owned code:code (restoreSessionData pushes it
             back and chowns it).

If the round-trip is broken the sentinel is absent after resume and this fails red.
