Regression test: a missing tool config directory at cleanup time must
not print a scary "Warning: Failed to save session data" — it should
be treated as "nothing to save" and logged silently.

Bug report on 0.8.0:

    [cleanup] Warning: Failed to save session data: failed to pull
    .config/opencode directory: exit status 1

Root cause in `internal/session/cleanup.go`:

    if err := mgr.PullDirectory(stateDir, localConfigDir); err != nil {
        if strings.Contains(err.Error(), "not found") ||
           strings.Contains(err.Error(), "No such file") {
            logger("No %s directory found in container")
            return nil
        }
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to pull %s directory: %w", ...)
    }

Two flaws stacked:

  1. `PullDirectory` in `internal/container/manager.go` used `IncusExec`
     which streams stderr to the terminal but returns only the bare
     `*exec.ExitError` — so the `err.Error()` passed to the substring
     match was just `"exit status 1"`, never the incus message body.
  2. The substring match only looked for "not found" / "No such file",
     but incus actually prints `Error: file does not exist` for a
     missing source path. Even if stderr had been captured, the match
     would still have missed.

Fix: capture stderr in `PullDirectory` into the returned error, and
broaden the substring match in `cleanup.go` to also accept
"does not exist" (case-insensitive). Both flaws are closed in one PR
because either fix alone would still leave the warning visible in
some configurations.

This test reproduces the exact conditions:

  1. Workspace with `[tool] name = "opencode"` in `.coi/config.toml`
     — picks a tool whose `ConfigDirName()` is `.config/opencode`
     (the one from the bug report).
  2. Spawn `coi shell` with `COI_USE_DUMMY=1` so the inner CLI is the
     scripted dummy (no real opencode, no real API calls).
  3. Exit the dummy to bash and `rm -rf ~/.config/opencode` — COI
     auto-injects `opencode.json` during setup, so the directory
     would otherwise exist. Deleting it inside the container
     guarantees the `PullDirectory` call in cleanup hits the
     "file does not exist" path.
  4. `sudo poweroff` to trigger the stopped-container cleanup branch
     that runs `saveSessionData`.
  5. Collect all pexpect-captured output after EOF.
  6. Assert the scary `Warning: Failed to save session data` string
     is NOT present, and the benign `No .config/opencode directory
     found in container` line IS present.

On master before the fix this test fails — the collected output
contains `Warning: Failed to save session data: failed to pull
.config/opencode directory: exit status 1` and does not contain the
"No .config/opencode directory found" line.
