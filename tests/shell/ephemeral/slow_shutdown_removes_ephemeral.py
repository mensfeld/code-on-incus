"""
Test for coi shell (ephemeral) - a SLOW guest shutdown must still end with
the container removed.

Cleanup distinguishes "user powered the container off" (delete it) from
"user typed exit" (keep it for re-attach) by polling the container state for
a fixed ~5s after the shell ends. Any shutdown slower than that window was
mislabeled as a normal exit: cleanup printed "Container kept running - use
'coi attach' to reconnect..." and the ephemeral container was never removed
(it finished stopping moments later and lingered as a stopped leftover).

The stock power wrappers (`close`/`poweroff`/...) use `systemctl --force
poweroff`, which skips unit stop jobs and usually finishes inside the old
window — which is exactly why the plain poweroff tests never caught this.
This test pins the guest in "stopping" deterministically: a transient unit
with a slow ExecStop plus a NON-forced `systemctl poweroff` (which honors
unit stops) keeps the container shutting down for ~30s.
