"""
Test for coi shell (ephemeral) - a guest shutdown that OUTLASTS the graceful
window must be force-stopped and removed, not relabeled "kept running".

Stock systemd gives service stops a 90s budget (DefaultTimeoutStopSec) while
COI's [container] shutdown_timeout defaults to 60s, so "detected shutdown
outlives the wait" is reachable with completely ordinary units. When that
happens the cleanup must escalate exactly like `coi shutdown` does after its
graceful window — force the stop and honor the ephemeral contract (delete) —
instead of relapsing into the "Container kept running - use 'coi attach'"
mislabel it was built to fix.

This test makes the overrun cheap: shutdown_timeout is pinned to 5s and a
transient unit holds the guest in "stopping" for ~30s.
