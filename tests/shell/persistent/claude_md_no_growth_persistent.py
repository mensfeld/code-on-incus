"""
End-to-end regression test for #674: the COI sandbox context block must not
accumulate in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md across sessions on a persistent container.

Background: coi injects a sandbox context block into the tool's native
auto-context file (Claude's ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) during session setup. On a
persistent container the file survives between sessions, and setup re-runs on
every session (the context block is re-rendered "for both new and resumed
sessions so dynamic info stays current"). So the block must be REPLACED, not
appended. Before the fix it was appended each session and the file grew without
bound — the reporter hit 16 identical copies / 108k chars, past Claude Code's
40k limit.

This drives the real `coi` CLI end-to-end. It creates one persistent container,
then reuses that SAME container across several sessions the way a real
stop/resume cycle does — stop it, then `coi shell --container <name>` to re-enter
it — so setup (and its auto-context injection) runs again against the same
persisted home. Each session uses `--background` (runs setup then detaches, so no
interactive/real `claude` binary is needed). The file is then read back from
inside the container; because "# COI Sandbox Environment" renders exactly once
per block, its occurrence count is the number of copies and must be exactly one.

The tool is intentionally left at its default (Claude) — i.e. COI_USE_DUMMY is
NOT set — because only the Claude tool implements the auto-context file path; the
dummy tool would never exercise it.
