"""
Test for coi shell in persistent mode - `close` stops the container and
cleanup reports it truthfully.

`close` is the in-container wrapper for `systemctl --force poweroff`: it
shuts the guest DOWN. In persistent mode the container must be KEPT but end
up STOPPED — and the cleanup message must say so. The persistent cleanup
branch used to print "Container kept running - use 'coi attach' to
reconnect..." unconditionally whenever the container existed, i.e. also
while `close` was powering it off, telling the user their instance was still
up when it was going (or already) down.
