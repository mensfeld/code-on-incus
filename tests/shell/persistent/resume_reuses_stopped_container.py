"""
Test for coi shell --resume in persistent mode - verifies the stopped container is reused.

When a persistent session is resumed, coi should restart the original stopped container
on the same slot rather than creating a fresh container on a new slot. This ensures that
system-level changes (installed packages, files outside ~/.claude) persist across resume.

Bug: AllocateSlot() only checks running containers, so a stopped persistent container's
slot appears "available" and a new slot is allocated, creating a fresh container.

Flow:
1. Start persistent session on slot 1
2. Exit to bash, create a marker file at /var/tmp/persist-marker-COI-TEST
3. Poweroff (container stops but is kept)
4. Verify stopped container still exists
5. Resume with --resume (no explicit --slot)
6. Check marker file exists (proves same container was restarted)
7. Cleanup
