"""
`coi run` (no args) executes a workspace-root `coi-run` script. The 0.10 claim
(#559 A7): a `coi-run` *symlink* is followed only if it resolves INSIDE the
workspace — a target outside it passes the host stat but would not exist in the
container, so COI fails fast host-side with an explanation. Unit-tested
(run_test.go); these are the missing end-to-end checks.
