"""
Test that coi run applies [network] and [ssh] settings from config.

Covers issue #373: coi run silently ignores network isolation and SSH agent
forwarding from config, unlike coi shell which applies both correctly.

Tests that:
1. coi run with network.mode = "restricted" blocks RFC1918 addresses
2. coi run with network.mode = "restricted" still allows public internet
3. coi run with network.mode = "open" does not block RFC1918 addresses
4. coi run with ssh.forward_agent = true sets SSH_AUTH_SOCK inside the container
