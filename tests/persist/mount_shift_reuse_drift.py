"""
Per-mount `shift` reuse-drift warning (#604).

[[mounts]] devices are created once and never re-added on reuse, so changing a
mount's `shift` in config is a silent no-op until the container is recreated.
COI must WARN about that drift on reuse instead of silently ignoring it.

The effective shift depends on the container's UID-mapping regime (an idmapped
`shift` mount vs a container-wide `raw.idmap`), so the test reads the
container's raw.idmap after the first launch and adapts:

  - shift regime  (raw.idmap empty): the mount is attached shift=false; flipping
    the config to shift=true is real drift -> warning expected.
  - raw.idmap regime (raw.idmap set): a shift=true override clamps to false
    (shift and raw.idmap are mutually exclusive), so there is no drift ->
    the warning must NOT appear.

Flow: launch a persistent, named session with a trusted out-of-workspace mount
at shift=false, then relaunch the SAME container with shift=true and inspect the
reuse warning on stderr.
