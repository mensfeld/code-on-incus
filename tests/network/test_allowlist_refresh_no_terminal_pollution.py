"""
Integration tests: allowlist network diagnostics must never reach the terminal.

Regression tests for https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/issues/372.

In allowlist mode coi resolves the allowed domains at setup and a background
goroutine periodically re-resolves them (TTL-aware) and updates the nft rules.
Before the fix, the resolver and nft helpers logged via the global `log` package
(stderr), which in a running `coi shell` is the user's tmux terminal — so every
refresh dumped lines like `example.com: resolved 3 IPs (TTL: 300s)` straight into
the Claude session. (An earlier fix only redirected the refresh goroutine's own
"IP refresh: ..." lines, so the resolver flood persisted in 0.9.)

These tests lock the *behaviour*, not the code:
  1. setup-time network diagnostics do not appear in the terminal, and ARE
     written to the session log files (~/.coi/logs/<container>.{stdout,stderr}.log);
  2. a real background refresh fires in a live session and its output goes to the
     log file, NOT the attached terminal.
