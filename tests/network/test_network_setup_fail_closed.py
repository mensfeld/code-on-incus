"""
A network-isolation setup failure must fail CLOSED: the session aborts rather
than running the command with an un-isolated (potentially open) network.

COI applies a boot block (zero egress) right after the container starts and lifts
it only once the mode's firewall rules are in place; on a `setupRestricted` /
`setupAllowlist` error it deliberately keeps the block and returns the error
(`internal/network/manager.go`). If a refactor lifted the block on the error path
instead, a failed setup would silently proceed with an open network. This e2e
proves the user-observable half of that invariant end to end (the boot-block nft
rule itself is asserted by the Go integration test
`TestSetupForContainer_SetupError_KeepsBootBlock_Integration`, which needs incus).

The failure is induced with an allowlist whose only domain cannot resolve
(`.invalid` is reserved as always-NXDOMAIN, RFC 6761), so `setupAllowlist` errors
with "failed to resolve any allowlisted hostname".
