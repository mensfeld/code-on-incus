"""
Project (.coi/config.toml) config must not be able to weaken network isolation.

A repo-supplied or agent-planted project config that sets
block_metadata_endpoint=false / block_private_networks=false / mode=open is a
silent downgrade of the secure defaults. COI refuses such downgrades from
project scope (with a warning); only the user's ~/.coi/config.toml or an
explicit COI_CONFIG may relax them.
