"""
Integration tests for allowlist mode's deterministic name resolution.

Allowlist mode does not let the container resolve names itself. COI resolves the
allowlisted hostnames on the host, installs those addresses in the firewall, and
writes the SAME addresses into the container's /etc/hosts. All DNS egress is then
blocked, so that hosts file is the container's only route from a name to an
address.

That equality is the point. The old design resolved on the host, pinned the
result, and left the container to resolve independently — and for any domain
behind a rotating pool of frontend addresses (every Google API endpoint) the
container routinely got a different member of the pool, one the firewall had
never seen. The packet hit the default reject and the agent died mid-task with
"Unable to connect", healing seconds later when a retry happened to land on an
address that had been pinned.

Nothing has to stay running for the new guarantee to hold: the hosts file and the
firewall are both already in place and they already agree. It survives `coi`
exiting, the user detaching from tmux, or the process being killed — which is
exactly what an in-process DNS proxy could not do, since `coi shell --background`
returns immediately and the container outlives it.
