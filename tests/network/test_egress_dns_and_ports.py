"""
End-to-end tests for the egress-policy controls dns_servers (DNS resolver
pinning) and allowed_ports (destination-port allowlist), driving REAL traffic
from inside the container.

These run in CI's network lane against real Incus + nftables + internet, which is
what makes them the enforcing coverage for the feature — the Go
`*_integration_test.go` counterparts self-skip without Incus and are not run by
this lane.

Both keys are TRUSTED-SCOPE ONLY (a resolver pin is a DNS-redirect primitive; the
port cap is honored from trusted scope for a uniform rule), so every test supplies
them via `write_trusted_coi_config` (COI_CONFIG env), NOT a workspace
.coi/config.toml — a project-scope config would have them stripped at load.

Test targets are raw public IPs (no DNS needed for the probe itself), and each
"blocked" assertion is paired with an "allowed" assertion to the SAME host on a
different port (or the same port on a different host), so a block can never pass
for the wrong reason (host simply unreachable):
