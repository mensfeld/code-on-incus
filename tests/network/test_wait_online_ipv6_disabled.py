"""
Regression test for issue #548 — systemd-networkd-wait-online must not hang
when coi disables IPv6 in the container.

In restricted/allowlist mode coi disables IPv6 (DisableIPv6AtBoot pre-start +
DisableIPv6ForContainer post-start). With IPv6 kernel-disabled, systemd-networkd
otherwise keeps failing to add the IPv6 link-local address, so eth0 never leaves
the "configuring" setup state and systemd-networkd-wait-online — hence
network-online.target and everything ordered after it (docker.service, and the
reporter's ollama.service) — hangs indefinitely.

The fix pre-seeds an IPv4-only networkd config (05-coi-ipv4-only.network) so the
link reaches "configured" and wait-online completes. This test drives `coi run`
(the session-setup path, not `coi container launch`) in restricted mode on the
systemd coi-default image and asserts the boot transaction settles with
wait-online no longer queued. It runs a few times because the pre-fix hang was
an intermittent race between the IPv6 disable and networkd's boot config.

Lives in the `network` CI group (`tests/network`), which stands up the
restricted-mode nft/firewall environment.
