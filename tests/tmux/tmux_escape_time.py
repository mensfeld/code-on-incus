"""
Behavioral test for tmux escape-time in the coi-default image.

Regression for https://github.com/mensfeld/code-on-incus/issues/378:
When using nested tmux (e.g. SSH → host tmux → COI tmux), the default
escape-time of 500ms stacks at each nesting level, causing the Escape key to
feel completely broken in applications like opencode/vim.

The fix ships `/etc/tmux.conf` with `set -g escape-time 10` so the Escape key
is delivered to applications promptly even in nested setups.

Tests that:
1. /etc/tmux.conf declares escape-time 10.
2. The Escape key actually passes through nested tmux within 200ms — a
   behavioral end-to-end check that would fail at the 500ms default because
   the inner tmux would not have flushed the byte to the application yet.
