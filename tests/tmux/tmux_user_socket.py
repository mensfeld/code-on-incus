"""
Regression tests for #588: coi tmux capture/send/list must exec as the
container's code user, not root.

tmux sessions are per-user (socket at /tmp/tmux-<uid>/default). The sessions
created by `coi shell --background` run as the code user, so helpers that
exec as root connect to /tmp/tmux-0 and fail (capture/send) or silently see
nothing (list). The pre-existing tmux tests masked this by creating their
sessions via a root `coi container exec` — root helpers against a root
session "worked", but that flow never happens in the product.

Covers:
1. Default code user (uid 1000 in coi-default)
2. A remapped code user (uid 501 — the [incus] code_uid / raw.idmap family
   from the issue report, simulated with usermod like
   remapContainerUserIfNeeded does)
3. That the helpers create no root tmux socket as a side effect
