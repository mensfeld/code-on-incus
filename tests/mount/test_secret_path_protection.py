"""
Workspace secret-path masking must hide repo-local secrets from the agent.

`security.secret_paths` lists workspace-relative globs (e.g. `.env`, `*.pem`,
`secrets/**`). COI masks each match inside the container by mounting an empty,
read-only file/dir over it, so the contained agent can neither READ its contents
(exfil protection) nor MODIFY it (tamper protection). The host file is untouched.
Issue #494.
