"""
Test for UID mapping fix using raw.idmap instead of shift=true.

Validates that raw.idmap correctly maps the host user's UID to the container's
code user UID (1000), allowing full read/write access regardless of host UID.

This is the fix for the shift=true bug: raw.idmap explicitly maps
"both <hostUID> 1000", so the container's code user always sees host files
as its own.

Uses incus init (not launch) to create the container without starting it,
sets raw.idmap and security config before first boot — matching the
production code path in session/setup.go.

Tests that:
1. Create container without starting (incus init)
2. Enable Docker/nesting support (security flags)
3. Set raw.idmap to map host UID -> container UID 1000
4. Mount workspace WITHOUT shift
5. Start container
6. As code user (UID 1000), read, create, and overwrite files
7. All operations succeed regardless of host UID
