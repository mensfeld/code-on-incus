"""
Built-in "hardened" profile: a one-flag hardened preset for opening untrusted /
freshly-cloned repos (`coi shell --profile hardened`). Issue #496.

It bundles COI's strongest EXISTING controls (no new enforcement): restricted
network, secret masking, host immutability, ephemeral container, no SSH-agent
forwarding, and threat monitoring. It ships built-in (no disk profile needed),
so these checks need neither incus nor sudo — they assert the preset is present
and shows the hardened settings via `coi profile`.
