"""
Regression test for issue #398: error messages referenced the non-existent
'--network=open' flag, causing users to follow broken instructions.

Root cause: when firewalld is unavailable, COI printed:
  "Alternatively, run with unrestricted network access: coi shell --network=open"
But '--network' was removed as a CLI flag in an earlier refactor and is
now configured via config.toml. Following the suggestion produced:
  "Error: unknown flag: --network"

Fix: all four occurrences of '--network=open' in user-facing strings were
replaced with instructions to set 'mode = "open"' in the [network] section
of config.toml.

This test verifies:
  1. 'coi shell --network=open' fails with "unknown flag: --network",
     confirming the flag does not exist and the old messages were wrong.
  2. 'coi health' output never contains '--network=open', confirming the
     fix is in place regardless of the system's firewalld state.
