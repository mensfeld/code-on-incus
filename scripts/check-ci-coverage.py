    A lane can narrow a big test file to a subset of classes via

    how test_security_monitoring.py is sharded. The failure mode is silent
    DRIFT: rename/add a class and a lane's `-k` still "passes" while that class
    never runs in CI, or a `-k` names a class that no longer exists (dead
    reference). For every single-file lane path that carries a `-k`, this

      - every `Test*` class declared in the file is named by some lane's `-k`
