// Allowlist mode makes the container's name resolution deterministic instead of
// live: COI resolves the allowed domains on the host, installs those addresses in
// the firewall, and writes the SAME addresses into the container's /etc/hosts.
// All DNS egress is then blocked (see the port-53 rules in nft_filter.go), so the
// hosts file COI wrote is the container's only way to turn a name into an address.
//
// This is what kills the original bug at the root. The old design resolved on the
// host, pinned the result, and left the container to resolve the same name
// independently — and for any domain behind a rotating pool of frontend addresses
// (every Google API endpoint) the container routinely got a different member of
// the pool, one the firewall had never seen. The two sides disagreed, the packet
// hit the default reject, and the agent died mid-task with "Unable to connect".
//
// Here there is only one source of truth. The container cannot resolve a name to
// an address the firewall does not already trust, because there is nowhere else
// for an address to come from. Nothing has to stay running for that to hold: the
// hosts file and the nft set are both already in place and they already agree, so
// the guarantee survives `coi` exiting, the user detaching from tmux, or the
// process being killed. Stale-but-consistent is a working container; the thing
// that broke was fresh-but-divergent.
//
// An agent with root inside the container can of course overwrite /etc/hosts. That
// costs it its own name resolution and gains it nothing — the firewall is still
// the boundary, and an address it invents is an address the firewall rejects. The
// failure is closed and self-inflicted.
