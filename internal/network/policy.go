//
// It splits the configured entries into the two things allowlist mode treats
// differently:
//
//   - Literal addresses (raw IPv4, CIDR) go straight into the container's static
//     nft set. They involve no name resolution at all.
//   - Names are resolved once, on the host. Their addresses go into the dynamic
//     nft set AND into the container's /etc/hosts. With DNS egress blocked, that
//     hosts file is the container's only route from a name to an address — so the
//     two sides cannot disagree, and the container cannot reach an address the
//     firewall has not already been given.
