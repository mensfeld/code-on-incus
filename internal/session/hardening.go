// restartStoppedContainer. Two distinct checks with two distinct remedies:
// instance-LOCAL drift means a restart will converge it (the reconcile fixes
// local config), while an EFFECTIVE-surface violation means an attached Incus
// profile pins a key the policy needs unset — a restart alone won't fix that,
// so the warning names the profile as the thing to edit.
