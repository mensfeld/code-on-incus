// aborts with "missing or unsuitable terminal: <TERM>". We map such values to a
// widely-available 256-color equivalent that preserves color support, while
// letting genuinely standard TERMs pass through unchanged.
//
// The rule is deliberately broad on the xterm- namespace: any xterm-<vendor>
// value that is not one of the standard entries is mapped, so a new emulator
// (the next xterm-kitty) is handled without another code change (#772).
